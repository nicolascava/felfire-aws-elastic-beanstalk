## Getting started

Felfire AWS Elastic Beanstalk is part of the [Felfire](https://github.com/nicolascava/felfire) plugin ecosystem.

## Why Felfire AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

Felfire AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a plugin that takes compiled sources from a Felfire app or server then deploy it to a specified AWS Elastic Beanstalk app.
 
Its purpose is to improve the developer experience on deployment pipelines.

## Command

Felfire AWS Elastic Beanstalk will take sources from the build directory (e.q. `buildDir` from Felfire's configuration) to do its deployment process:

```bash
felfire aws-elastic-beanstalk [--env=some-env]
```

### Option

`--env`: specify a AWS Elastic Beanstalk app environment where to deploy (e.q. `staging`).

## Custom configuration

Here are the full options explained:

```json
"plugins": [
  ["aws-elastic-beanstalk", {
    "app": "my-application-name",
    "bucket": "my-bucket-name",
    "region": "us-west-2",
